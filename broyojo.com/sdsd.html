<h2>Broyojo.io release info-</h2>
<p>The news is that the developers have taken a break on developing this game. They will start again on April 1, 2017. The game has been worked on extensively in the past, but is very complicated, and a full release in the near future would be unexpected. The developers, however are optimistic about progress on the game, and you may expect an alpha or beta version of the game to come out in the near future, possibly before 2018.</p>
